## Tesla Clone: A React & Tailwind CSS Project

This project is a replica of the Tesla website, built using React JS and styled with Tailwind CSS. It leverages the power of Vite for a fast development experience.

## Getting Started

1. Prerequisites:

Node.js (version 14 or later): https://nodejs.org/en
Basic understanding of React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

2. Clone the Repository:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/Manish-S0/tesla-clone-react-tailwind.git

3. Install Dependencies:

Bash
cd tesla-clone-react-tailwind
npm install

4. Run the Development Server:

Bash
npm run dev

This will start the development server and open the application in your default browser, usually at http://localhost:5173/.

## Project Structure

The project follows a clean and organized structure, with components and styles separated for maintainability:

* src/: Contains all application code.
  * components/: Houses reusable React components for the UI.
  * App.jsx: The main application entry point.
  * main.jsx: Renders the App component in the root of the application.
* public/: Stores static assets like images and fonts.
* package.json: Manages project dependencies and scripts.

## Tailwind CSS Configuration

Tailwind CSS is pre-configured to include essential utility classes for building the Tesla UI. You can further customize the configuration in tailwind.config.js.

## Scripts

The package.json file defines the following scripts for development and building:

* npm run dev: Starts the development server with hot module replacement for seamless development.
* npm run build: Creates an optimized production build of the application.
  
## Customization

Feel free to modify the components, styles, and data to reflect your specific design choices and features you want to implement. The project provides a solid foundation for building your vision of a Tesla website clone.
